First Basic HTML Project

* Putting together everything I've learned so far
    - Memorized HTML boilerplate 
    - Learned different HTML elements (i.e strong, em, p, hn, a, img)
    - Learned attributes for links and images (i.e href, src, and alt)
    - Have a firmer grasp on git workflow (i.e add, commit, push)
